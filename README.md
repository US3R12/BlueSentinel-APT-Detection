BlueSentinel â€“ Real-Time Threat Hunting & Incident Response

Overview
**BlueSentinel** is a self-initiated cybersecurity project that simulates enterprise-level threat hunting using **Suricata**, **Zeek**, **Wireshark**, and the **ELK Stack**. It focuses on detecting **APT-style behavior** such as beaconing, lateral movement, and command-and-control traffic, mapped to the **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**.

Tools & Technologies
- Network Monitoring**: Suricata, Zeek
- Packet Analysis**: Wireshark
- SIEM**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Detection Engineering**: Sigma Rules
- Threat Framework**: MITRE ATT&CK

Objectives
- Identify key attacker TTPs (e.g., **T1071: Application Layer Protocol**, **T1043: Commonly Used Port**)
- Create detection rules using **Sigma**
- Perform live packet capture and analysis
- Visualize and respond to threats via Kibana
